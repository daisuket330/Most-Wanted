create function
prompt user 
first i want to be able to search a person by one criteria from an array of options

if the search meets the criteria it should return true
if false it wont return

for example: if the criteria is name,and the elements are [alpha,bravo,charlie,delta];
and i'm searching for charlie
i want the function to ultimatley eliminate all other elements but charlie
and return charlie
to do this i can filter by first letter
